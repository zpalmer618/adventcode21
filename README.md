# Advent of Code 2021

A simple repository for my solutions to the [Advent of Code]
(https://adventofcode.com/) projects. These will be attempted in
python, but I may branch out to other programming languages later to
work on those skills.

## Advent 0f Code: Day 1 - Sonar Sweeper

You are tasked with finding the keys to Santa's sleigh that were
dropped in the ocean. You are on an elf-made submarine and are tasked
with determining if every sweep on the sonar has either increased or
decreased in depth since the last sweep.
